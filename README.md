# World Weather Analysis

## Overview 
It's great to have a vacation, but what if the weather is intolerable? We can help with that!

_Note:_ This is my second try at this repository--the first one needed to be deleted because I was not pushing from the command line and I ended up putting my config.py file out there.

### Purpose
This collection of code allows the user to select their preferred maximum temperature weather conditions and view cities from a randomly-generated list. Then the user can select four nearby cities to create a travel itinterary. 

## Deliverable 1: Retrieve Weather Data
Retrieve at least 500 random cities by generating latitudes and longitudes, then gather their weather data in a dataframe.

## Deliverable 2: Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
Gather user weather preferences for Max Temp, then use this to filter the data from Deliverable 1. Find nearby hotels and place them on a map with marker information.

## Deliverable 3: Create a Travel Itinerary Map
Select 4 cities for a road trip from the map in Deliverable 2. Create a map with the directions to go from city to city, ending at the starting city. Then produce a map with marker information for just these cities.
